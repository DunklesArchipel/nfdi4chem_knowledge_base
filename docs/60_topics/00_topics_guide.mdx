For data to be interoperable and reusable, [data formats standards](62_data_formats/00_format_standards.mdx) are of utmost importance. Development here is ongoing and we will continue to add information on formats.

In order to ensure that data are permanently referenced and cited, repositories assign unique [persistent identifiers (PIDs)](/docs/pid). By linking the journal publication to the data publication, findability of the data files for re-use is guaranteed.

Annotating data with machine-readable [metadata](63_data_description_annotation/10_metadata.mdx) plays into nearly all aspects of FAIR and ensures data are understood by machines and humans alike. Here, the core concepts of [ontologies](/docs/ontology) in one's research domain proves helpful.
