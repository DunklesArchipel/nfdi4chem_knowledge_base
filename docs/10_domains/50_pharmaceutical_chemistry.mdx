## Introduction
Medicinal chemistry is a chemistry-based, strongly interdisciplinary discipline. It deals with the discovery, development, identification, and synthesis of biologically active compounds, the interpretation of their mechanism of action at the molecular level, and the metabolism of the active compounds. The interactions of active compounds with their biological target(s) are analysed in silico (chemoinformatics), in vitro, and in vivo to determine selectivity and potential in terms of their therapeutic efficacy and safety. Medicinal chemists prepare and/or select suitable compounds for biological evaluation that, if found to be active, could serve as lead compounds. Chemical modifications to optimise these leads ideally result in promising candidates for preclinical studies in drug development, potentially followed by clinical studies.


## Data Types
The most common types of data in pharmaceutical/medical chemistry can be divided into three categories: Synthesis data, analytical data and (bio)assay data. While the first two types of data (synthesis and analytical data) play a role in broad areas of chemistry, (bio)assay data, for example to investigate the biological activity of a substance, are a specialty of pharmaceutical/medical chemistry.


## ELNs and Other Tools
Tools such as RDMO and DMP-Online are suitable for planning research data management and creating data management plans. Many universities have their own instances of one of these solutions. 

Electronic lab notebooks are particularly suitable for implementing the requirements of FAIR data management, as they can relieve researchers of many documentation tasks.For example, the following ELNs are used in the community:
Chemotion ELN, Sicformation, eLabFTW, eLabJournal, labfolder, Benchling. The [ELN finder](https://eln-finder.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/search?f.K03=Pharmacy,equals&spc.page=1) has even more options. How to select the right ELN for the workgroup can be [read here](/docs/choose_eln).


## Publishing Data
Publishing research data is important in order to give other researchers the opportunity to reuse it. In order to reach as many researchers as possible, choosing the right repository can be crucial (more on this in the article on [choosing the right repository](/docs/choose_repository).

For synthesis data and analytical data, specific repositories such as [Chemotion Repository](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome) (synthesis data), [MassBank EU](https://massbank.eu/) (mass spectra) or [nmrXiv](https://nmrxiv.org/) (for NMR data) are recommended. For the third category of data ((bio)assay data) no optimal repository is currently known, therefore the generic repository [RADAR4Chem](https://radar.products.fiz-karlsruhe.de/de/radarabout/radar4chem) is recommended.


## Challenges
Compared to many other areas of chemistry, pharmaceutical/medical chemistry often involves very application-oriented research, which can lead to patents and product developments. For this reason, the electronic laboratory notebooks used are subject to particularly high demands in the area of audit trials. This must be taken into account from the outset when selecting the tools used. This can also lead to special requirements when publishing research data.

The diversity of the data formats used and the analysis methods also pose a challenge for good RDM. Especially when laboratory/analysis devices are used that can no longer be integrated into a network due to their software, or only via detours.
