# Smart Laboratory (Smart Lab)

![smartlab_flow](/img/smartlab/smartlab_flow2.png)

A smart lab represents a holistic approach to [data management](/docs/data_guide) in chemistry with seamless data flows. What does this mean? It means that all steps within a researcher's [workflow](/docs/domain_guide) across the [research data lifecycle](/docs/data_life_cycle) are interconnected in a digital way. The key difference to a [Laboratory Management System (LIMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_information_management_system) is that the Smart Lab's main focus is the realisation of the [FAIR data principles](/docs/fair). For example, a researcher plans and [documents](/docs/data_documentation) their experiment in an [electronic lab notebook (ELN)](/docs/eln). Any experimental data from devices such as spectrometers are then directly ingested by the ELN via [Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). 

The ELN then ideally assigns all the necessary [metadata](/docs/metadata) automatically and appropriately for a corresponding workflow and converts proprietary [data formats](/docs/format_standards) to open data formats. The ELN structures the (meta)data and experimental descriptions in a meaningful and sustainable way which is both human- and machine-readable (e.g., via the use of [machine-readable chemical structures](/docs/machine-readable_chemical_structures). When the researcher chooses to [publish](/docs/data_publishing) or [archive](/docs/data_storage) their data, it is then ingested seamlessly by a data [repository](/docs/repositories) or archive without much further work as the ELN has already appropriately prepared the dataset to meet a repository’s or archive’s [requirements](/docs//choose_repository). 

In this section, key components of the smart lab will be introduced to you.
