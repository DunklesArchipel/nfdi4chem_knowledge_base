On this page we collect a non-exhaustive list of data publication standards, formulated as principles, that have been developed within the NFDI4Chem Publication Standards project. These standards are intended to improve the quality of metadata and streamline publication workflows, including the review process of manuscripts with corresponding datasets published in research data repositories. 

For more generic information for authors on publishing in field-specific and generic, multidisciplinary repositories such as publishing data in open formats or providing machine-readable chemical structures alongside the analytical data, please have a look to our page on [Best-Practices](/docs/best_practice/).

:::info Applies to:
Authors, publishers and infrastructure operators are the target audiences for these standards.

## For Authors

### Use ORCID iD to Identifiy Authors and ROR to Identifiy Institutions

:::tip Standard
*Authors should provide their ORCID iD to identify the authors/creators and contributors, and their ROR identifier to identify the institution to which they are affiliated.*
::: 

ORCID iDs allow authors to be uniquely identified, whereas author names may not be unique, may change, or may have different ordering conventions depending on cultural differences. Similarly, affiliations can vary according to style and granularity. In order to uniquely identify the institutions to which authors are affiliated, the ROR identifier should be provided. Please note that the ROR identifier is not intended to resolve down to the departmental level. Nevertheless, both identifiers improve findability.

### How to use Dataset PIDs in Scientific Articles

During deposition of research data, a [persistent identifier (PID)](/docs/pid) is assigned to the data. Authors should use PIDs in their scientific article for interlinking and referencing in **two main ways**:

#### How to use Dataset PIDs of own Datasets in Scientific Articles


:::tip Standard
*Authors should add the PID of their corresponding dataset(s) to the data availability statement and should add PIDs of dataset(s) to the reference section in order to specifically cite dataset(s).*
::: 

For corresponding data, i.e. directly underlying the results reported in the article, add the PID to the article's [data availability statement](/docs/data_availability_statement), or a similarly termed section. In order to specifically reference and cite your data within the text, add your dataset to the references as well.

:::danger Notice:
This distinction is important, because **the link** to the dataset in CrossRef's DOI metadata of scientific articles **is differently set**, depending on whether the dataset is a directly related source of information or a specifically referenced resource.
:::

#### How to use Dataset PIDs of Datasets of other Researchers in Scientific Articles


:::tip Standard
*Authors should include PIDs for datasets published by other researchers that have been reused in the references, rather than citing the corresponding article.*
:::

For datasets published by other researchers and reused in a study, include the dataset PID in the reference section of the manuscript and cite within the text accordingly.

### How to Link Datasets to their Corresponding Scientific Article

:::tip Standard
*Researchers should link their datasets to be published to their corresponding articles by adding the article DOI to the dataset's DataCite metadata as a related identifier.*
:::

Research data repositories offer the option to add a related identifier to link datasets to related resources, such as a corresponding article. This considerably enhances the [FAIRness](/docs/fair/) of datasets, mainly the findability ([F2](/docs/fair/#f2-data-are-described-with-rich-metadata-defined-by-r1-below)) as well as the interoperability ([I3](/docs/fair/#i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-to-other-metadata)).

### Usage of Relation Type for Linking Datasets with Scientific Articles

:::tip Standard
*Researchers should link their datasets to be published to their corresponding articles using the relation type `IsSupplementTo` .*
:::

According to the [DataCite Metadata Schema](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/appendices/appendix-1/relationType/), [`IsCitedBy`](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/appendices/appendix-1/relationType/#iscitedby) and [`IsSupplementTo`](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/appendices/appendix-1/relationType/#issupplementto) are both recommended for discovery. On the other side of the pond, [CrossRef's documentation on relationships](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/markup-guide-metadata-segments/relationships/) recommends that `isSupplmenetTo` should be used to link datasets generated as part of research results. 

### Usage of Collection DOIs

:::tip Standard
*Researchers should use the Collection DOI provided by a repository in the data availability statements of their corresponding manuscript to wrap research data objects that are relevant to that an article to be published.*
:::

Field-specific research data repositories may provide DOIs to reference individual chemical reactions, molecules, and their analytical data. Generic, multidisciplinary research data repositories provide DOIs for a whole published datasets, while more than one published dataset may be relevant to study results published via an article. In other words, many DOIs may be relevant to a published article, whereas **a data availability statement may provide some DOIs but not many DOIs**. 

To facilitate the process of manuscript submission and article publication, researchers should add the **Collection DOI** provided by the repository to the data availability statement. This will ensure that all data underlying a published manuscript can be linked to an article in the data availability statement and the CrossRef metadata of that article. 

If individual reactions, molecules or analytical data should be referenced, add the DOIs of these individual research objects to the reference section and cite within the text accordingly.

## For Publishers and Journals

### Recommendations for Trusted, Chemistry-friendly Repositories

:::tip Standard
*Journals should recommend trusted, chemistry-friendly research data repositories.*
:::

To assist authors in selecting **well-established and community-specific [repositories](/docs/repositories/)** for their research data, [trusted chemistry friendly repositories](/docs/choose_repository/) should be recommended by journals. These should be included within the author guidelines or the data policies.

### Recommendations to Include Data Availability Statements

:::tip Standard
Journals should recommend that authors provide a data availability statement. Author guidelines should also provide templates for illustration.*
:::

[Templates](/docs/data_availability_statement/#templates-for-data-availability-statements) for [**data availability statements**](/docs/data_availability_statement) or similarly termed section should be made available to authors in author guidelines of journals. This guides authors in correctly submitting underlying data with their manuscript and effectively communicating how to find and access the data by including the DOI or other PID, enabling the FAIR principles (e.g. [A1](docs/fair#a1-metadata-are-retrievable-by-their-identifier-using-a-standardized-communications-protocol), [I3](/docs/fair#i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-to-other-metadata)). It should also be mentioned if templates are selectable and information should be provided via the manuscript submission system.

### Data Availability Statements and Manuscript Submission Systems 

:::tip Standard
*Journals should add a data availability statement to published articles and collect the necessary information through their submission systems.*
:::

[Templates](/docs/data_availability_statement/#templates-for-data-availability-statements) for data [**availability statements**](/docs/data_availability_statement) or similarly termed section should also be added to the manuscript submission system. Once a template has been selected by the submitter, the data availability statement should be editable to allow authors to add additional information, such as what data are included in the dataset, similar to what is currently often mentioned in the section on supporting information PDF files. The submission system should then require the submitter to provide the necessary information, such as the DOI (specified as [DOI name](https://www.doi.org/doi-handbook/HTML/doi-name-syntax2.html) e.g. `10.1000/182` or as a URL i.e. including a resolver e.g `https://doi.org/10.1000/182` ), repository name, third party name and contact information, or reasons for restricted access and information on how to access a dataset, depending on the template used.

### Link Datasets to Articles in CrossRef DOI Metadata

:::tip Standard
*Journals should use the information available in data availability statements to enhance CrossRef DOI metadata by linking articles to datasets.*
:::

With the DOI and repository name in hand, journals should enrich CrossRef DOI metadata of articles published following the [FAIR](/docs/fair/) principles (e.g [F2](/docs/fair/#f2-data-are-described-with-rich-metadata-defined-by-r1-below), [I3](/docs/fair/#i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-to-other-metadata)). This establishes a structured **link** between the DOI of the article and the  DOI of the dataset and ensures humans and machines alike can interpret the relationship between the published objects. For CrossRef metadata, a `related_item` should be added to mention the name of the repository (equal to `publisher` in the corresponding dataset DataCite DOI metadata). 

In XML:
```xml
<rel:program name="relations">
	<rel:related_item>
		<rel:description>
		Dataset in <repository name>.		
		</rel:description>
		<rel:inter_work_relation relationship-type="isSupplementedBy" 
identifier-type="doi">10.prefix/suffix
		</rel:inter_work_relation>
	</rel:related_item>
</rel:program>
```

In agreement with [Crossref's documentation on **linking datasets** to published items](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/markup-guide-metadata-segments/relationships/), the relationship type `isSupplementedBy` should be used.

### Add Data Publications to Prior Publication Policy

:::tip Standard
*Journal author guidelines should explicitly encourage pre-submission of datasets.*
:::

Similar to the publication of preprints, journal author guidelines should allow for the pre-submission of datasets, as this is also already the case for many journals for crystallographic data published in CSD with CCDC. Datasets published prior to manuscript submission facilitate manuscript submission workflows as DOIs of dataset are registered, DOIs can be validated and datasets can be included in the review process.

:::danger Danger
A disadvantage of pre-submission is that researchers cannot link the dataset to the manuscript, as the manuscript has not yet been published and no DOI has been registered. The metadata of the dataset need to be manually updated by the authors after the article got published. Datasets with status *under review* are one way to overcome this disadvantage (see below).
:::

### Recommendations to Include Research Data in the Review Process

:::tip Standard
*Journal author guidelines should explicitly encourage to include research data in the review process.*
:::

Some repositories have an *under review* status alongside the *draft* and *published* statuses. A dataset *under review* is not editable and not published, i.e. it does not have a DOI registered, which can be validated. Nonetheless, the dataset has an internally reserved DOI and is accessible via a URL to provide access to editors and reviewers. This allows research data to be included in the review process. The URL to access the dataset should be requested by the submission system so that it can be forwarded to editors and reviewers.

### Encourage to Publish Datasets prio Publishing Articles

:::tip Standard
*Journal author guidelines should require that datasets under review get published prior an article gets published.*
:::

To assist in automated workflows, such as linking the datasets to the published article through their respective PIDs, **datasets *under review* should be published prior to the publication of the article**. Once a manuscript is accepted, the authors should be informed to publish their dataset *under review*. This ensures that the data has a registered DOI when the article gets published. Consequently, journal can run quality control checks on the provided DOI such as validation. This process must be explicitly communicated with authors through the author guidelines, yet can also be included within other communication upon acceptance. Contemporaneous, the DOI for the article should be provided so that authors can include this information in their dataset's metadata prior to the publication of the dataset. Finally, the article gets published, and its DOI gets registered.

### Scholix.org

:::tip Standard
*Journals and publishers should use Scholix.org.*
:::

[**Scholix**](https://doi.org/10.1045/january2017-burton) provides the framework for improving the links between scientific literature and research data as well as between data and data with the goal of providing a **high-level interoperability framework for exchanging information about these links**. Thus, Scholix hubs, such as [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) or [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu/), contribute information on their metadata records, which contain information on connected digital objects. This information should be used academic publishers to discover datasets that correspond to an article but were published after the article was published, which allows the metadata of the article to be updated with links to the dataset (see above).

## For Research Data Infrastructure and Resource Providers

### Metadata Should be Part of a Dataset 

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should include the metadata in datasets downloaded by researchers.*
:::

While researchers upload their data, metadata is attached. For generic, multidisciplinary repositories, additional metadata is provided via a metadata editor. For field-specific repositories, the metadata is extracted from the analytical data files and provided by researcher along their lab workflows, as this is the case for Chemotion ELN. Once data is retrieved from a repository, this metadata should not be lost but should be included in the downloaded package. The minimum to include is the descriptive DataCite metadata. 

[BagIt](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8493.html), a set of hierarchical file system conventions, is one solution for including metadata in downloaded dataset.

### Structured Domain-Specific Metadata Should be Part of a Dataset

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should include structured, domain-specific metadata in datasets downloaded by researchers.*
:::

Beside of metadata following generic schemes such as DataCite's metadata scheme, domain-specific metadata should be part of each dataset. This metadata should also be provided in datasets downloaded by researchers for reuse. 

One solution to this is to include Schema.org metadata by [combining RO-Crate and BagIt](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.1/appendix/implementation-notes.html#adding-ro-crate-to-bagit).

### Collection DOIs

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should provide a Collection DOI to wrap research data objects that are relevant to an article to be published.*
:::

Field-specific research data repositories may provide DOIs to reference individual chemical reactions, molecules, and their analytical data. Generic, multidisciplinary research data repositories provide DOIs for a whole published datasets, while more than one published dataset may be relevant to study results published via an article. In other words, many DOIs may be relevant to a published article, whereas **a data availability statement may provide some DOIs but not many DOIs**. To facilitate the process of manuscript submission and article publication, each repository should provide a **Collection DOI** that wraps relevant data that should be referenced in the data availability statement. This will ensure that all data underlying a published manuscript can be linked to an article in the data availability statement and the CrossRef metadata of that article.

### Embargo Period and Metadata Accessibility

:::tip Standard
*Datasets published with an embargo period should have inaccessible data but accessible metadata.*
:::

While an **embargo** period restricts access to a published dataset, the **metadata should be accessible** – *publish* with embargo. This allows relevant information on the dataset to be retrieved and enables [FAIR](/docs/fair) ([A2](/docs/fair/#a2-metadata-are-accessible-even-when-the-data-are-no-longer-available)), while guaranteeing first rights to the data to the authors. Findable and accessible metadata is required to link articles and datasets, as DOIs to datasets need to be **validated** before the metadata record of articles gets updated.

### Scholix.org

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should contribute to Scholix.org.*
:::

[**Scholix**](https://doi.org/10.1045/january2017-burton) provides the framework for improving the links between scientific literature and research data as well as between data and data with the goal of providing a **high-level interoperability framework for exchanging information about these links**. Thus, Scholix hubs, such as [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) or [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu/), contribute information on their metadata records, which contain information on connected digital objects. This information is used by academic publishers to discover datasets that correspond to an article but were published after the article was published, which allows the metadata of the article to be updated with links to the dataset.

### Datasets under Review

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should provide access to datasets under review.*
:::

In order to include datasets in the review process of manuscripts, repositories should provide access to reviewers. It is strongly encouraged that repositories provide a status *in review* beside of the statuses *draft* and *published*. **A dataset under review should not be editable but should be accessible** via a URL, while the DOI is not yet discoverable and the DOI metadata is not yet accessible as the dataset is not yet published.

### Reviewer Access to Datasets under Review

:::tip Standard
*URLs to access datasets under review should have the access credentials encoded in the URL.*
:::

**Review links** for datasets *under review* should have the **access credentials** encoded in the URL, rather than having separate login and password. This avoids having to forward these details to the reviewer via the submission system. 

### Publisher and PublisherIdentifier in DataCite Metadata

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should provide the repository name as 'publisher' as well as a 'publisherIdentifier' in a dataset's DataCite metadata.*
:::

DOI prefixes are specific to each registrant. As each registrant may host more than one repository, the prefix is not necessarily specific to an individual repository. As stated by [**DataCite's documentation on the publisher field**](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/properties/publisher/#publisher), the required `publisher` field is used to formulate the citation of the data and should therefore be the repository name. In addition, a repository identifier such as the re3data identifier should be provided to unambiguously identify the repository. Both fields should be automatically populated by the repository and should not be editable by the submitter. 

In the case of RADAR4Chem the relationship would be described as follows:

>Publisher: RADAR4Chem
>
>publisherIdentifier: http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJNAY
>
>publisherIdentifierScheme: re3data 
>
>schemeURI: https://re3data.org/

In XML:
```xml
<publisher xml:lang="en" publisherIdentifier="http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJNAY" publisherIdentifierScheme="re3data" schemeURI="https://re3data.org/">RADAR4Chem</publisher>
```

This ensures humans as well as machines can trace and interpret where the data has been published.

### Metadata Corrections and Updates

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should allow researchers to correct and update the metadata of datasets.*
:::

As the process of adding metadata via a metadata editor can be error-prone, creators should be allowed to **correct and update** the PID metadata as well as any other metadata. For full transparency, metadata may be **versioned**. The record may indicate to viewers that changes were made. Updating of metadata contributes to [FAIR](/docs/fair) ([F2](/docs/fair/#f2-data-are-described-with-rich-metadata-defined-by-r1-below)) by enhancing the richness of metadata, and also allows creators to add additional related identifiers for recently published related datasets and articles. 

### Legal Issues on Dataset Abstract 

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should inform authors and data curators about possible rights conflicts for the abstract field in the datasets DataCite metadata.*
:::

Dataset's should have their **own description as an abstract**. Copying the related article abstract can result in a **rights conflict** with the respective academic publisher. This is particularly the case in German law. Authors and data curators should be informed of this conflict, e.g. via a **tooltip** when adding metadata using a metadata editor.

### Group Licences

:::tip Standard
*In research data repositories, licences should be grouped into research data licences and software licences.*
:::

Repositories often tend to provide confusingly long lists of licences. Furthermore, **licences** differ for datasets and software. Providing a **grouping** will greatly assist authors in selecting from the correct set. 

### Encourage Creative Commons Licences

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should encourage researchers to choose a Creative Commons licence to simplify the landscape of licences and their choice.*
:::

In line with grouping licences between software and datasets, pointing authors towards the selection of [**Creative Commons (CC)**](https://creativecommons.org/) licence alleviates the selection process. When publishing research data, Creative Commons licences that are no more restrictive than CC BY are strongly recommended.

### Promote the least Restrictive Creative Commons Licences

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should suggest licences such as CC0 or CC BY by pre-selecting such a licence rather than more restrictive licences such as CC BY-SA or even CC BY-NC-ND, which can make reuse very difficult.*
:::

Shared data should be as **open as possible, as closed as necessary** with the intent of allowing and enabling others to reuse and build upon the work. Thus, encouraging rather open licences such as **[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/)** and **[CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licences/by/4.0/)** as opposed to more restrictive licences such as [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licences/by-sa/4.0/) or even [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licences/by-nc-nd/4.0/).

### Creators and Contributors

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should label fields for creators in their (DataCite) metadata editor as authors/creators.*
:::

Researchers are used to talking about authors when it comes to the publication of results with one of the scientific publishers. On the other hand, DataCite distinguishes between authors and contributors, with the latter also being assigned a role. To avoid confusion for researchers who want to publish their data, metadata editors of repositories should guide researchers when adding metadata by labelling the field for creators in their (DataCite) metadata editors as authors/creators.
