:::info Info:
This page is under construction, while you are welcome to read the already existing paragraphs. On this page we will summarise the standards for the publication of data, formulated as principles, developed within the NFDI4Chem project on Publication Standards. These standards should streamline the publication workflows. Authors, publishers and infrastructure operators are the audience for these standards.

## For Authors

### How to use dataset PIDs in scientific articles

<!--Standard on how to publish NMR data, tbd-->


During deposition of research data, a [persistent identifier (PID)](/docs/pid) is assigned to the data. Authors should use PIDs in their article for interlinking in two main ways:

:::tip Standard
*Authors should add the PID of the corresponding dataset(s) to the data availability statement. In addition, authors should add corresponding datasets to the references, making them citable within the text of the article.* 
::: 

For corresponding data, i.e. data directly underlying the results reported in the article, add the PID to the article's [data availability statement](/docs/data_availability_statement), or a similarly termed section. If you believe that your data publication is as decisive as the article itself, add your dataset to the references as well and cite within the text.

:::tip Standard
*Authors should add PIDs to datasets by other researchers, which have been reused to the references rather than citing the corresponding article*
:::

For datasets published by other researchers and reused within a study, add the PID to the reference section of the manuscript and cite within the text accordingly.

:::info Notice:
This distinction is important, because the link to the dataset in the DOI metadata of scientific articles is differently set, depending on whether the dataset is a directly related source of information or a referenced source by other researchers and its information has been reused.
:::

For a set of reactions, samples, and analyses, to assemble a study, **Collection PIDs** should be used rather than providing many separate PIDs. Such a study wrapped with a Collection PID can directly correspond to a published scientific article and can be referenced in a bundled manner within the [data availability statement](/docs/data_availability_statement) or references section.

In addition, but second-tier, the PID of a related dataset could also be mentioned in the supplementary PDF, if such a document is generated.

### How to link scientific articles to thier corresponding dataset(s)

Many data repositories will offer the option to add a related identifier. According to the [DataCite Metadata Schema](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/appendices/appendix-1/relationType/), [`IsCitedBy`](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/appendices/appendix-1/relationType/#iscitedby) and [`IsSupplementTo`](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/appendices/appendix-1/relationType/#issupplementto) are both recommended for discovery. As stressed [above](#how-to-use-dataset-pids-in-scientific-articles), while datasets _may_ be cited within the article, the data availability statement should include them, first and foremost. Hence, to ensure the correct linking on the side of the datset, the relation type `IsSupplementTo` should primarily used, while `IsCitedBy` can be used in addition if the dataset is indeed referenced.

## For Research Data Infrastructure and Resource Providers

### Collection DOIs

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should provide a Collection DOI to wrap research data objects that are relevant to an article to be published.*
:::

Field-specific research data repositories may provide DOIs to reference individual chemical reactions, molecules, and their analytical data. Generic, multidisciplinary research data repositories provide DOIs for a whole datasets published, while more than one published dataset may be relevant to study results published via an article. In other words, many DOIs may be relevant to a published article, whereas **a data availability statement may provide some DOIs but not many DOIs**. To facilitate the process of manuscript submission and article publication, each repository should provide a **Collection DOI** that wraps relevant data that should be referenced in the data availability statement. This will ensure that all data underlying a published manuscript can be linked to an article in the data availability statement and the CrossRef metadata of that article.

### Embargo Periode and Metadata Accessibility

:::tip Standard
*Datasets published with an embargo period should have inaccessible data but accessible metadata.*
:::

While an **embargo** period restricts access to a published dataset, the **metadata should be accessible**. This allows relevant information on the dataset to be retrieved and enables [FAIR](/docs/fair) ([A2](/docs/fair/#a2-metadata-are-accessible-even-when-the-data-are-no-longer-available)), while guaranteeing first rights to the data to the authors. Findable and accesible metadata is required to link articles and datasets, as DOIs to datasets need to be **validated** before the metadata record of articles gets updated.

### Scholix.org

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should contribute to Scholix.org.*
:::

[**Scholix**](https://doi.org/10.1045/january2017-burton) provides the framework for improving the links between scientific literature and research data as well as between data and data with the goal of providing an **high-level interoperability framework for exchanging information about these links**. Thus, Scholix hubs, such as [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) or [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu/), contribute information on their metadata records, which contain information on connected digital objects. This information is used by academic publishers to discover datasets that correspond to an article but were published after the article was published, which allows the metadata of the article to be updated with links to the dataset.

### Datasets under Review

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should provide access to datasets under review.*
:::

In order to include datasets in the review process of manuscripts, repositories should provide access to reviewers. It is strongly encouraged that repositories provide a status *in review* beside of the statuses *draft* and *published*. **A dataset under review should not be editable but should be accessible** via an URL, while the DOI is not yet discoverable and the DOI metadata is not yet accessible as the dataset is not yet published.

### Reviewer Access to Datasets under Review

:::tip Standard
*URLs to access datasets under review should have the access credentials encoded in the URL.*
:::

**Review links** for datasets *under review* should have the **access credentials** encoded in the URL, rather than having separate login and password. This avoids having to forward these details to the reviewer via the submission system. 

<!--

:::tip Standard
*Repositories should register a DOI and populate main fields such as creator and contributor, if a dataset is under review.*
:::

This ensures that journals may carry out automated **quality control steps upon manuscript submission**. Further details within the dataset's metadata and content may still be adjusted and updated prior to final publication.

I commented this out, as the DOI should be registered when something gets published. One idea to address the chicken and egg problem for linking is that article DOIs get registered as soon as an manuscript is accepted. Only a minimum of metadata may be providede such as author and publisher names. Then, authors need to add the DOI of their article to the metadata of the dataset before the galleys and the dataset should get published and a DOI is registered. After the galley i.e. directly before the article gets published the academic publisher should also add the DOI of the dataset to their DOI (CrossRef) metadata and update all other metadate field with information already providede today.  

-->

### Publisher and PublisherIdentifier in DataCite Metadata

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should provide the repository name as 'publisher' as well as a 'publisherIdentifier' in a dataset's DataCite metadata.*
:::

DOI prefixes are specific to each registrant. As each registrant may host more than one repository, the prefix is not neccesarily specific to an individual repository. As stated by [**DataCite's documenation on the publisher field**](https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/en/4.5/properties/publisher/#publisher), the required `publisher` field is used to formulate the citation of the data and should therefore be the repository name. In addition, a repository identifier such as the re3data identifier should be provided to unambiguously identify the repository. Both fields should be automatically populated by the repository and should not be editable by the submitter. 

In the case of RADAR4Chem the relationship would be described as follows:

>Publisher: RADAR4Chem
>
>publisherIdentifier: http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJNAY
>
>publisherIdentifierScheme: re3data 
>
>schemeURI: https://re3data.org/

In XML:
```xml
<publisher xml:lang="en" publisherIdentifier="http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJNAY" publisherIdentifierScheme="re3data" schemeURI="https://re3data.org/">RADAR4Chem</publisher>
```

This ensures humans as well as machines can trace and interpret where the data has been published.

### Metadata Corrections and Updates

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should allow researchers to correct and update the metadata of datasets.*
:::

As the process of adding metadata via a metadata editor can be error-prone, creators should be allowed to **correct and update** the PID metadata as well as any other metadata. For full transparency, metadata may be **versioned**. The record may indicate to viewers that changes were made. Updating of metadata contributes to [FAIR](/docs/fair) ([F2](/docs/fair/#f2-data-are-described-with-rich-metadata-defined-by-r1-below)) by enhancing the richness of metadata, and also allows creators to add additional related identifiers for recently published related datasets and articles. 

### Legal Issues on Dataset Abstract 

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should inform authors and data curators about possible rights conflicts for the abstract field in the datasets DataCite metadata.*
:::

Dataset's should have their **own description as an abstract**. Copying the related article abstract can results in a **rights conflict** with the respective acedemic publisher. This is particularly the case in German law. Authors and data curators should be informed of this conflict, e.g. via a **tooltip** when adding metadata using a metadata editor.

### Group Licenes

:::tip Standard
*In research data repositories, licences should be grouped into research data licenses and software licenses.*
:::

Repositories often tend to provide confusingly long lists of licences. Furthermore, **licenses** differ for datasets and software. Providing a **grouping** will greatly assit authors in selecting from the correct set. 

### Encourage Creative Commons Licences

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should encourage researchers to choose a Creative Commons licence to simplify the landscape of licences and their choice.*
:::

In line with grouping licences between software and datasets, pointing authors towards the selection of [**Creative Commons (CC)**](https://creativecommons.org/) license alleviates the selection process. When publishing research data, Creative Commons licences that are no more restrictive than CC BY are strongly recommended.

### Promote Least Restrictive Creative Commons Licences

:::tip Standard
*Research data repositories should suggest licences such as CC0 or CC BY by pre-selecting such a licence rather than more restrictive licences such as CC BY-SA or even CC BY-NC-ND, which can make reuse very difficult.*
:::

Shared data should be as **open as possible, as closed as necessary** with the intent of allowing and enabling others to reuse and build upon the work. Thus, encouraging rather open licences such as **[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/)** and **[CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)** as opposed to more restrictive licenses such as [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) or even [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).

## For Publishers and Journals

<!---Add Scholix!--->

The below outlines a collection of standards for publishers and journals.

---

:::tip Standard
*Articles should be linked within their DOI metadata to dataset(s) with the `relation` `type` `is-supplemented-by` and the dataset(s) should link to the article using the `relationType` `IsSupplementTo`.*
:::

This agrees with [Crossref's documentation on **linking datasets** to published items](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/schema-library/markup-guide-metadata-segments/relationships/). It establishes a structured **link** between both PIDs and ensures humans and machines alike can interpret the relationship between the published objects.

---

:::tip Standard
*Journals should recommend trusted, chemistry-friendly research data repositories.*
:::

To assist authors in selecting **well-established and community-specific repositories** for the research data, [trusted chemistry friendly repositories](docs/choose_repository) should be recommended by journals. These should be included within the author guidelines or the data policies.

---

:::tip Standard
*Journals should add data availability statements to their submission system.*
:::

During manuscript submission, editable [templates](/docs/data_availability_statement/#templates-for-data-availability-statements) for [**data availabilty statements**](/docs/data_availability_statement) should be provided to authors. This guides authors in correctly submitting underlying data with their manuscript and effectively communicating how to find and access the data by inlcuding the DOI or other PID, enabling the FAIR principles (e.g., [A1](docs/fair#a1-metadata-are-retrievable-by-their-identifier-using-a-standardized-communications-protocol), [I3](/docs/fair#i3-metadata-include-qualified-references-to-other-metadata)).

---

:::tip Standard
*Journal author guidelines should explicitly encourage pre-submission of datasets.*
:::

To assist in automated workflows, such as linking the datasets to the published article through their respective PIDs, **datasets should be published prior to the publication of the article**. Thus, once an article is accepted, the authors should publish the underlying data, ensuring that data is avilable when the article is published and that the journal editors can run quality control checks on the provided DOI. This process must be explicitely communicated with authors through the author guidelines, yet can also be in included within other communication upon acceptance. At this point, the DOI for the article should be provided so that authors can include this information in their dataset's metadata prior to publication.
