:::

Nomad is a public repository operating since 2015 that is hosted at the MPCDF (Max Planck Computing and Data Facility) in Garching, Munich. It contains over 12 million datasets **(simulations)** generated from over 500 users, 98% of which is published. DOIs are attributed to almost half of them. Their target audience are solid state physicists and theoretical chemists. Data on **computational** materials science, computational **chemistry**, and molecular physics are those typically contained in the repository. There is a simulation data recognition process during upload and the repository supports the input/output formats of 50 different codes. NOMAD offers an API for data import and export. The repository is recommended by [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#materials) of the Nature publishing group.
