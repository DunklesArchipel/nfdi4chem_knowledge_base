# Common Data Types and Formats

Based on the results generated by a [survey](https://doi.org/10.1002/zaac.202000339) carried out by the NFDI4Chem consortium in 2020 and the yearly interviews with the repository leaders performed by NFDI4Chem's Task Area 3 repository team, a list of the most common data types and formats within this community was collected and is reported in Table 1. This table displays which data types are most commonly collected within the chemistry community and suggests which repository is most suitable for storing your specific data type.

The information provided in Table 1 will also guide you to efficiently and quickly select the best repository for the storage of your specific type of chemistry data.
