:::

STRENDA DB is a **field-specific** repository for **enzymology** data operated since 2016 and hosted at Beilstein Institute (BI) Frankfurt. It ensures that datasets are complete and valid before scientists submit them as part of a publication. Their target audience is biochemists, systems biologists, biocatalysts in the fields of life sciences, biological, molecular, and food chemists. The typical data contained in this repository consists of **functional enzymology data** (kinetic and experimental data) from manuscripts and publications. Data entered in the STRENDA DB are automatically checked (according to STRENDA Guidelines and a PDF fact sheet with submittable input data), allowing users to receive notifications for necessary but missing information. Currently, more than [55 international biochemistry journals](https://www.beilstein-institut.de/en/projects/strenda/journals/) already include the STRENDA guidelines in their instructions for authors. **DOI** is used as the identification system for citations and ORCID iD as the identification system for authors. Data viewing is possible via open access and data contribution is possible after a required registration where the current **AAI** is provided through an internal user administration (user, administrator).
