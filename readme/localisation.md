# Localisation

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/nfdi4chem-knowledge-base/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/nfdi4chem-knowledge-base)

The NFDI4Chem Knowledge Base is currently offered in [English](https://knowledgebase.nfdi4chem.de/knowledge_base/) and [German](https://knowledgebase.nfdi4chem.de/knowledge_base/de/).

## How does it work?

We use a [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/nfdi4chem-knowledge-base) for translating all pages. Whenever new contents are merged to the [`localisation`](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/knowledge_base/tree/localisation) branch, the English sources are automatically uploaded to Crowdin for translation.

As soon as the translation is finished, the branch localisation will be merged into the [`main`](https://github.com/NFDI4Chem/knowledge_base/tree/main) branch. The public website will subsequently be automatically rebuilt with the English sources and the translations downloaded from Crowdin.

If you just want to contribute to the German translation, feel free to make the necessary changes via Crowdin. When you are done, the site will be rebuilt using the existing English source and the updates from Crowdin.

## How can I contribute to translating?

Please get in touch with [us](mailto:helpdesk@nfdi4chem.de), we will invite you as a member in the Crowdin project and discuss all important issues.
